## About This Site

- About: This site is a React single-page web application. It is built with react-router, Firebase and JWS Authentication, express js and MongoDB.

- Authentication: I have added login and registration features. You can register by email password. An access token will be generated as soon as the user logins. Valid user will be checked with that token.

- User Role: According to the role of the user, the dashboard will show the data, one can load only as much data as it is allowed. According to the end roll, different data will be shown.

- Payment method: Added payment method, only HR can make payment, and a user can pay salary only once in a month.

- Experience: I faced a lot of challenges while doing this project because I had to do some things that I had never learned before. However, I was able to gain some experience by doing the project.
